# Force-Directed Graph Visualization    

This project is an interactive Force-Directed Graph implemented using p5.js. Force-directed graphs use physical simulation to position nodes based on their relationships.

## How It Works

The simulation uses the force-directed layout algorithm, where:

1. Nodes repel each other, simulating a repulsive force.
1. Edges act like springs, pulling connected nodes together.

Physics principles (e.g., Hooke's Law for springs and Coulomb's Law for repulsion) are used to achieve a natural layout.
